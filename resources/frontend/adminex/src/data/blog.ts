    title: 'Getting Started with React 19: A Comprehensive Guide',
    slug: 'getting-started-with-react-19',
    excerpt: 'Explore the new features and improvements in React 19, including the new compiler, server components, and enhanced hooks.',
    content: `
      <p>React 19 brings a wealth of new features and improvements that make building modern web applications easier and more efficient than ever before. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore everything you need to know to get started.</p>

      <h2>The New React Compiler</h2>
      <p>One of the most exciting additions in React 19 is the new compiler. This compiler automatically optimizes your React code, eliminating the need for manual memoization in most cases. The compiler analyzes your code and applies optimizations that previously required manual intervention with useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo.</p>

      <h2>Server Components</h2>
      <p>Server Components have been refined and are now production-ready. They allow you to render components on the server, reducing the JavaScript bundle size sent to the client and improving initial page load performance.</p>

      <h2>Enhanced Hooks</h2>
      <p>React 19 introduces several new hooks and improvements to existing ones:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>useOptimistic</strong> - Handle optimistic UI updates with ease</li>
        <li><strong>useFormStatus</strong> - Track form submission states</li>
        <li><strong>use</strong> - A new way to read resources in render</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>React 19 represents a significant step forward for the framework, making it easier to build fast, efficient, and maintainable applications. Whether you're starting a new project or upgrading an existing one, these new features will help you deliver better user experiences.</p>
